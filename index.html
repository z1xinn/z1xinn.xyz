                        Hi, my name's Akimitsu (Known as Zixin). I'm assuming you've come across this webpage because you know me, (I mean, how else would you find this?). I'll keep this description of me short and concise. I'm a student, majoring in information technology,
                        but I also do internships at tech firms specialising in cloud management and technology consulting, collborating with major businesses around the world. Other than my education and career, I enjoy playing games like Valorant and Minecraft. I also use
			a web-chat app called Discord to ocassionally complete commissions involving Discord Server enhancement and building. I enjoy chatting with people and collborating with others to complete projects.

                <h3>SS (Solar Slayer)</h3>
                <h4>Lead Technical Engineer</h4>
                <p>
                    One of my more memorable projects, kept the server going for a few months before ultimately shutting it down because of inactivity and server instability. Had fun collaborating with Hourly, Tomioka, YorSa, KHyper(DVK) while creating this project. One of the servers which really jumpstarted my technical ability.

                <h4>Web Designer and Lead System Engineer</h4>
                <p>
                    Yeah, I think most of you can infer that SS and Eclipse had some relations. I'd say that Eclipse was a prerequisite of SS, it was one of my first ever projects, being the actual kickstarter of my interests in digital design. Collaborated with most of the same people in SS, minus Hourly and a few others.

                    This was my most ambitious projects so far, amounting to piqueing several hundred members' interests. Throughout this experience, I was placed in several roles including being the supervising marketing lead. Most of my skills in digital design and marketting came from this project, with me using many apps to furthermore improve and develop my technical prowess. I won't go into specifics because this truly was a long project, with me depositing money into it.

                            Although I'm currently free and have no comissions nor projects, I recently worked on the Cloud Network alongside Kiri to create a stable server with regular players. Even though the server only peaked at 40 players, it's still nice to mention this project because it really helped with my collaborative experience, building an enjoyable experience with Kiri.
